Global TODO list:

- utility to wait for channel creation\deletion (using inotify?). get rid of cyclic check-and-sleep logic when awaiting for comm-channel creation\deletion
- va-api integration (check, maybe it is already working)
- helper script to perform session reconnect (by providing sandbox config file, exec-profile name and session number for non-exclusive sessions)
- spec files for rpm building
- manuals, docs
- create some automated tests (using expect ?)
