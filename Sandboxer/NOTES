- dbus watchdog
- pulse audio integration
- dri integration
- va-api integration (check, maybe it is already working)
- helper script to perform session reconnect (by providing sandbox config file, exec-profile name and session number for non-exclusive sessions)
- helper sctipt to perform sandbox termination (by providing sandbox config file)
- install-script for user and system locations
