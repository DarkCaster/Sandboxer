Global TODO list:

- x11xpra feature as alternative to x11host - forward x11 by using xpra software (or such) to improve security when isolating x11 applications
- utility to wait for channel creation\deletion (using inotify?). get rid of cyclic check-and-sleep logic when awaiting for comm-channel creation\deletion
- va-api integration (check, maybe it is already working)
- helper script to perform session reconnect (by providing sandbox config file, exec-profile name and session number for non-exclusive sessions)
- helper sctipt to perform sandbox termination (by providing sandbox config file)
- install-script for user and system locations
- spec files for rpm building, and such stuff for other packaging systems
- manuals, docs
- create some automated tests (using expect ?)
