# Simple desktop application sandboxing tool for GNU\Linux

Helper scripts and tools for desktop application sandboxing.
Using bubblewrap utility to perform sandboxed env setup.
Extra custom tools used to perform application launch inside sandbox and communication to host env.

This project now is in active development stage (and code merging from my old tools for similar tasks)

So, it is not intended for any real use right now (minimum functionality for real use scenarios will be available soon)
